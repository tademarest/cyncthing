C Bindings for Syncthing

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to wrap in C the main components of the Syncthing project, which is written in Go. This is in hopes that Syncthing will be portable to iOS possibly via Qt. The inspiration for this project comes from working with Syncthing - a great project, and one that encouraged me to get started with Go - and the desire to see it on the iOS platform. This https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6125683/call-go-functions-from-c QA from stackoverflow got me interested in pursuing the idea further.


## TODOs

Try https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile to build the Objective-C bindings.
